# Fake-news-detection-ML




##  Project Overview

This project focuses on the detection of fake news using machine learning techniques. As misinformation becomes a significant concern, the project aims to provide a reliable tool for identifying potentially deceptive news articles.

## Methods and Techniques

The project involves preprocessing and vectorizing textual data, training various classification models, and evaluating their performance. The models are trained on a dataset containing both real and fake news articles. Key dependencies include Scikit-learn, NumPy, and Pandas.

## Training Models

Various classification models, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines, are employed. The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and the models are trained to classify news articles as real or fake.

## Evaluation and Results

Model performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Results are presented through classification reports and confusion matrices. Ensemble methods are explored to improve overall performance.

## Predicting Fake News

The trained models can be used to predict whether a given news article is likely to be real or fake. The project provides scripts or applications for users to interact with the models and receive predictions.

## Dependencies

- Scikit-learn: [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)
