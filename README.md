# Fake-news-detection-ML




##  Project Overview

This project focuses on the detection of fake news using machine learning techniques. As misinformation becomes a significant concern, the project aims to provide a reliable tool for identifying potentially deceptive news articles.

## Methods and Techniques

The project involves preprocessing and vectorizing textual data, training LSTM Recurrent Neural Network, and evaluating its performance. The model was trained on a dataset containing ~200,000 news articles both real and fake. Key dependencies include Scikit-learn, NumPy, and Pandas.


## Predicting Fake News

The trained models can be used to predict whether a given news article is likely to be real or fake. The project provides scripts or applications for users to interact with the models and receive predictions.

## Dependencies

- Scikit-learn: [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)
- NumPy: [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
- Pandas: [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- TensorFlow [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)

## How to Use
1. Clone repository and cd into server directory
1. Run command 'python app.py' and navigate to local host.
3. Explore model predictions for new news articles.
